screeps-starter-python
==========

This repository is a starter Python AI written for the JavaScript based MMO game, [screeps](https://screeps.com).

While code uploaded to the server must be in JavaScript, this repository is written in Python. We use the
[Transcrypt](https://github.com/QQuick/Transcrypt) transpiler to transpile the python programming into JavaScript.

Specifically, it uses [my fork of transcrypt](https://github.com/daboross/Transcrypt) built with
[a few modifications](https://github.com/daboross/Transcrypt/commits/screeps-safe-modifications) intended to reduce
the overhead of running Python in the Screeps environment. Nothing against Transcrypt itself, and you're free to change
the installed fork my modifying `requirements.txt`! I've just found a few changes useful that I've tested in node.js
and the screeps environment, but that I don't have time to generalize enough to include in the main transcrypt codebase.

This repository is intended as a base to be used for building more complex AIs, and has all the tooling needed to
transpile Python into JavaScript set up.
