## Syntax Changes: Transcrypt vs. Python

- [`in` operator differences](syntax-changes/in-operator.md)
- [list behavior differences](syntax-changes/lists.md)
- [`del` operator differences](syntax-changes/del-operator-overload.md)

If there is anything else you've found, do file an issue in the screeps-starter-python repository and I will include it here.
Transcrypt uses the Python interpreter itself to parse source code, but it doesn't replicate the python runtime perfectly.
When in doubt, looking at the created `main.js` file can provide a lot of insight into how things run.
